                            <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                                The Centre of Technical Excellence, Sarawak (CENTEXS), established in 1973 in Malaysia,
                                focuses on providing vocational and technical training for school leavers and working
                                students. With the rapid advancement of internet technologies and emerging industries in
                                the 21st century, students face increasingly intense competition in the job market,
                                while enterprises demand highly skilled professionals with recognized certifications.
                                However, CENTEXS faces significant challenges: high costs of offline teaching limit
                                accessibility and scalability; students lack access to high-quality online learning
                                resources to enhance their professional skills; obtaining government- and
                                industry-recognized certifications remains difficult; and there are limited channels for
                                students to understand industry employment trends. At the same time, enterprises
                                experience long recruitment cycles, struggle to quickly identify suitable talent, and
                                lack transparent access to students’ academic performance and skill data. These
                                challenges highlight the urgent need for CENTEXS to modernize its training and talent
                                development model.
