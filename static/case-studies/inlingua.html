              <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                As learner expectations evolved, inlingua Singapore faced increasing pressure to deliver a seamless and
                engaging learning experience across both classroom and online environments. The existing approach
                resulted in fragmented learning journeys, limiting continuity and learner engagement.

              <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                In addition, there was limited real-time visibility into learner progress, participation, and skill

                decisions.

              <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Instructors also experienced a high workload in delivering personalized feedback at scale, impacting
                efficiency and consistency across programs.

              <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                While aiming to expand its offerings, inlingua Singapore needed a scalable solution that could maintain

              <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                To address these challenges, inlingua Singapore sought a unified platform that could support blended
