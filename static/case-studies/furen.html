                                As a preparatory school, Fu Jen International School (FIS) is committed to preparing
                                students for university entrance and aims to become the most influential preparatory
                                education institution in Asia. However, with the changing forms of education and
                                students' learning needs, the traditional teacher-driven classroom learning model is no
                                longer sufficient to meet the new challenges. Students need to engage in self-directed
                                learning outside the classroom in order to explore subject content in depth, improve
                                learning efficiency and develop independent learning skills.

                                FIS wanted to leverage technology to build an online learning platform that not only
                                supports independent learning, but also ensures that students are on the right track
                                through the provision of guided learning resources and online assessments to enhance
                                learning outcomes. At the same time, the school needed a powerful management system to
                                help teachers manage classes, track students' learning progress, and conduct
                                comprehensive data analysis in order to provide students with personalized education
