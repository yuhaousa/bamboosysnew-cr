                With the development of education digitalization, Coco Education has been gradually expanding its
                primary and secondary math training in Singapore, facing the need to improve the efficiency of teaching
                management. In order to cope with the complexity of course scheduling, individualized needs of students,
                and increasing pressure on operations management, Coco Education has partnered with Nine Bamboo
                Education Technology to develop a comprehensive online teaching and management platform. The platform
                aims to systematize Coco Education's operational processes, enhance students' learning experience, and
                further consolidate its competitiveness in the education market through an intelligent scheduling system
                and efficient paid operations management functions.
