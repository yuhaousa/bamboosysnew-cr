                            <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                                Wavelink faces the challenge that traditional models of seafarer training are no longer
                                sufficient to meet the industry's growing demand for highly skilled practical
                                competencies. The existing training system primarily emphasizes theoretical instruction,
                                while lacking adequate practical skills training. As a result, seafarers often struggle
                                to handle complex maritime operations in real-world scenarios. Additionally, with the
                                rapid advancement of the maritime industry, the gap between seafarer qualifications and
                                industry requirements is becoming increasingly pronounced. Therefore, Wavelink requires
                                a training platform focused on enhancing practical operational abilities to address the
                                shortcomings of traditional methods and ensure seafarers are fully capable of performing
                                essential tasks in actual operations.
