                                Addressing Systemic Gaps in K–12 Education
                            </h3>

                            <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                                Since its establishment in 2005, Fun Learn’s School has been committed to researching
                                and promoting effective teaching and learning methods. While Singapore remains a global
                                leader in education and continues to increase government investment, the K–12 education
                                and training market still faces persistent structural challenges.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                                One major issue is excessive and unfocused tutoring. Many students attend multiple
                                supplementary classes without clear, targeted learning plans, increasing academic
                                pressure without delivering meaningful performance improvement.
                            </p>

                            <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                                In addition, a lack of interactivity in teaching content has resulted in disengaging
                                learning experiences, reducing student motivation and limiting long-term learning
                                effectiveness.

                                Outdated teaching concepts and limited innovation in instructional approaches further
                                hinder the ability of education providers to respond to rapidly evolving learner needs
                                and technological advancements.

                                Finally, insufficient data analysis tools make it difficult to accurately identify
                                student weaknesses, leading to imprecise assessments and limited adaptability in
                                teaching strategies.
