              <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Mendaki Education Institute is committed to delivering quality education to primary and secondary
                students, particularly those from multicultural backgrounds. With increasingly diverse learning methods
                and rising demand for personalized education, traditional teaching models struggle to meet the needs of
                all learners.
              </p>

              <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Students with slower progress or different learning styles often lack adequate individualized support,
                making it difficult to ensure consistent learning outcomes for every student.
              </p>

              <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Additionally, as digital education becomes more widespread, students and parents expect smarter, more
                customized online learning tools that can provide personalized guidance and track learning progress.

              <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                After a student registers, the platform understands the student's learning level and preferences through
                a series of assessments and automatically generates a personalized learning path that meets the
                student's learning needs. For example, for students with strong performance in math learning, the
                platform will provide more difficult topics, while for students who need more help, the platform ἁ
                arranges more basic exercises.

              <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                When students encounter difficulties during learning, the AI tutoring feature provides real-time
                guidance through a dialogue box, helping them overcome challenges. For example, if a student makes an
                error while solving a math problem, the AI analyzes the mistake and offers targeted hints to support
                step-by-step understanding and mastery of the concept.
