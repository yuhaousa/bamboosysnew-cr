                                large enterprise managing vast amounts of sensitive data, SP requires an online learning
                                platform that not only supports large-scale employee training but also provides robust
                                IT security to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access. Additionally, SP seeks to
                                collect learner feedback on customized courses to continuously refine its training
                                content.
